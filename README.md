## Rent It Forward

Rent it Forward is a site for when you want to buy something that you only need for a short period of time. You list an item and the price you would like to get for it when you are done with the item. Other users can make offers on that item which you can accept or reject. On the buyer side its a great place to get good deals on very gently used items.
